## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Jesse Pecar, I am a software developer with over 5 years of professional development experience. 
I have been working with .NET based products since I started my career, with many other frameworks being used as well.  

Some examples of frameworks that I have used professionally:

- ### Publix Super Markets
  - .NET Core 3.1
  - .NET Framework
  - ASP.NET
  - Xamarin.Forms
  - Blazor
  - Vue
  - React
  - Styling using Telerik and Bootstrap
- ### Benefithub
  - .NET Framework
  - React
- ### Microsoft
  - React
  - .NET 5+
- ### Driverse
  - React
  - React Native
  - Tauri
  - .NET 6+
  - Blazor
  - Styling using Telerik and TailwindCSS

In my personal projects, I have mostly focused on .NET backends and TypeScript front ends

- ### Grishaverse
  - This is a UI project written in React/Next that has some authentication and some small UI features
  - This used my base Auth setup that I use at home for basic (not really great) authentication used to give my personal projects a touch of professionalism
- ### Gubbies
  - This is a UI/API/Db project completely written in TypeScript that uses Angular frontend, NestJs backend with Prisma and Sequelizer for the DB seeding scripts
  - This app is something that I started building to mimic some of the applications that I have worked on professionally, but making it within the Angular framework to help teach myself Angular.
- ### FPC
  - This is a multi-repo project that is built in React/.NET that host a website for Florida Pool Consultants, a now defunct pool construction consultant firm.
- ### GameNight
  - This was a companion app that was written in Xamarin and React that was for game nights and working with SignalR and WebSockets for realtime user to user communication.
- ### And Many More...
